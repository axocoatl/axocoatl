## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Multi-turn tool-calling round-trip now works on every provider.** Agents
  could be handed tools, but the conversation could not continue after a tool
  ran: the agent loop never recorded the assistant's tool-call turn before the
  tool results, and the results carried no `tool_call_id`, so every follow-up
  request was malformed and rejected by the provider APIs. The full loop —
  model emits a tool call → the tool runs → its result is fed back → the model
  continues — now works on Ollama, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic, Gemini, and
  Mistral, in both the chat path and resumable sessions. Verified end-to-end
  against each provider's live API.
  - `ToolCall` moved into `axocoatl-core` (re-exported from `axocoatl-llm`) so
    the universal message model can reference it. `ChatMessage` and the
    persisted `StoredMessage` now carry an assistant turn's `tool_calls` and a
    tool result's `name` + `tool_call_id`; new fields are `#[serde(default)]`
    for backward compatibility.
  - The agent loop appends the assistant tool-call turn before dispatching and
    tags each result with its originating call, so the replayed conversation is
    well-formed for every provider's native format (OpenAI `tool_calls` +
    `role: tool`, Anthropic `tool_use`/`tool_result` blocks, Gemini
    `functionCall`/`functionResponse`).
  - Streaming tool-call deltas accumulate by provider `index`. OpenAI, Mistral,
    OpenRouter, and Ollama send the call id only on the first SSE chunk and key
    later argument fragments by index, so tool arguments split across many
    chunks now assemble correctly instead of fragmenting into bogus calls.
  - Gemini and Mistral now send tool definitions and parse tool calls; their
    `capabilities()` report `tool_calling: true`.
- **Tool calling on the OpenAI and Anthropic providers.** Both built the
  outbound chat request without attaching the tool definitions, so models on
  these providers never received the available tools and could not make tool
  calls — only the Ollama provider sent tools. OpenAI now attaches converted
  tools via a shared `build_chat_request` used by both `chat` and `chat_stream`;
  Anthropic attaches `tools` in `build_request_body`. Adds regression tests
  asserting the tool definitions reach the request.
- **Gemini and Mistral providers were non-functional for agents.** The agent
  runtime always streams (`stream_chat` → `provider.chat_stream`, no fallback),
  but both providers' `chat_stream` returned "Streaming not yet implemented", so
  any agent on `provider: gemini` or `provider: mistral` failed on its first
  turn. Implemented real token-by-token SSE streaming for both — Gemini via
  `streamGenerateContent?alt=sse`, Mistral via `stream: true` — matching the
  Anthropic provider's `reqwest_eventsource` pattern, with unit-tested chunk
  parsers.
- **Gemini targeted an endpoint that cannot do function calling.** The provider
  used the `v1` endpoint, which serves the current models but rejects the
  `tools` field outright (`Unknown name "tools"`) and has no `systemInstruction`
  field — so it can never make a tool call. Moved to `v1beta`, which serves the
  current models (e.g. `gemini-2.5-flash`) *and* supports both `tools` and
  `systemInstruction`; restored native `systemInstruction` instead of folding
  the system prompt into the first user turn. Verified end-to-end against the
  live Gemini API.
- **A corrupt or outdated checkpoint no longer prevents an agent from starting.**
  Checkpoint load now discards an undecodable snapshot (corruption, or a schema
  change across an Axocoatl upgrade) with a warning and starts fresh, instead of
  failing agent startup with a fatal deserialization error. A checkpoint is a
  regenerable cache, never a source of truth.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-24

First public release. The framework is functional end-to-end with a real LLM
(local via Ollama, or any configured provider).

### Added
- **Stigmergic multi-agent coordination**: EventLattice with pheromone-signal
  activation, HTN symbolic planning, and auction-based agent selection wired
  into the daemon. Agents in a workflow self-activate via a `depends_on` DAG —
  no central orchestrator.
- **Workflow execution**: `axocoatl workflow list|run`, `POST /api/workflows/{id}/execute`,
  and IPC support. Entry agents activate directly; downstream agents cascade
  via `TaskCompleted` events.
- **Full command surface** — previously stubbed commands now functional:
  `tokens report`, `agents status`, `agents restart`, `mcp servers`, `mcp tools`.
- **MCP integration**: daemon connects to configured MCP servers at bootstrap
  (stdio + streamable-http transports).
- **Developer experience**: `axocoatl onboard` interactive setup wizard and
  `axocoatl doctor` environment health check.
- **Distribution**: one-line install script and prebuilt binaries for Linux,
  macOS, and Windows; published to crates.io.
- Root `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore`, user-facing
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.

### Changed
- Workspace and all crates renamed from **Nexus** to **Axocoatl**.
- Version bumped from `0.0.1` (name-reservation placeholder) to `0.1.0`
  (first real release).
- Examples are now part of the workspace build and each has a README.

### Fixed
- Workflow coordination bug where the initial `UserInput` event spuriously
  activated downstream agents in parallel instead of cascading after their
  dependencies completed.
- `LICENSE` copyright attribution corrected to "Axocoatl Contributors".
- Zero compiler warnings across the workspace.
